              <p>
                Mental health is characterized by our emotional, psychological,
                and social well-being. It determines how we handle stressful
                situations, relate to others, and cope with the demands of life
                (Edwards et al., 2022). Mental health plays a large role in how
                we think, feel, and act.

              <p>
                Athletes may be more prone to eating disorders than the rest of
                the population. In a study conducted on the risk of disordered
                eating in college female athletes, it was determined that 76% of
                female athletes are susceptible to body dysmorphia and eating
                disorders (Torres-McGehee, 2021).

              <p>
                As a coach, you are uniquely positioned to detect psychological
                and physical changes within athletes. As prevention and early
                diagnosis are key factors for treatment (Heider et al., 2018),
                it is crucial to recognize symptoms, know how to communicate
                with your athletes, and be able to provide resources.

                Eating disorders stem from various causes and therefore require
                a multifaceted approach to treatment. Effective treatment plans
                will typically involve a multidisciplinary treatment team (MDTT)
                of professionals, including counselors, psychiatrists,
                dietitians, and medical staff (Carter, 2019; Conviser et al.,

      <h2>Mental Health & Collegiate Athletes</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health encompasses our psychological, emotional, and social
        welfare and is essential to overall well-being in the same way that
        physical health is. The importance of mental health tends to be
        downplayed in western culture and is considered even more taboo in
        sporting environments. Considering that mental illness is becoming
        increasingly prevalent among college-aged individuals (Edwards et al.,
        2022), it is more necessary than ever to be aware of the risk factors,
        as well as helpful resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collegiate student-athletes with mental health diagnoses have been
        growing in number over the past several years. This is potentially a
        result of the ever-growing college-related stressors surrounding the
        balance of academic, social, and athletic responsibilities (Edwards et
        al., 2022). Furthermore, the competitive leap from high school to
        college level athletics may amplify sport-specific pressures to maintain
        a certain body weight or physique (Arthur-Cameselle et al., 2018).
        Unfortunately, this can result in preoccupation with body-image and
        eventually more severe conditions, such as eating disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studies have suggested that athletes may be more prone to eating
        disorders than the rest of the population (Baum, 2013). This high rate
        of proneness is in large part a result of “contextual body image”, which
        refers to the contradicting body image demands from popular media versus
        sport (Carter, 2019; Shen, 2022). Those in sports in which lower body
        fat is advantageous and where they are judged on physique or compete in
        revealing uniforms, such as swimmers, are at highest risk. Female
        athletes specifically have reported feelings of extreme awareness of
        their bodies and other’s evaluations of them while competing in
        revealing uniforms like swimsuits (Lauer et al., 2018).

      <h2>Terms & Conditions To Know</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Anorexia Athletica:</span>
        Presenting in female athletes and involving fear of weight gain when
        underweight. Patients experience weight loss of at least 5% of body
        weight resulting from limited food intake and compulsive exercise. Other
        symptoms may include binge eating and pathogenic weight control methods
        (i.e., self-induced vomiting or use of laxatives or diuretics)
        (Thompston & Trattner Shermon, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Anorexia Nervosa – Restricting Type:</span>
        Extreme fear of weight gain and preoccupation with caloric intake and
        body image. Maintains low body weight through drastically restricting
        food intake.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Anorexia Nervosa – Binge/Purge Type:</span>
        Extreme fear of weight gain and preoccupation with caloric intake and
        body image. Binge eating and/or purging behaviors are routinely present.
        Such behaviors may include self-induced vomiting, abuse of laxatives,
        diuretics, or enemas, and excessive exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define"
          >Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder:</span
        >
        Also known as selective eating disorder, ARFID is a condition in which
        the amount or type of food ingested is limited. Unlike anorexia nervosa,
        there is no fear or preoccupation with weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Binge Eating Disorder:</span>
        Repeated episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food as a result
        of feeling out of control. Unlike with bulimia nervosa, these binge
        episodes are not followed by purging behaviors
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Body Dissatisfaction:</span>
        Discontent with entire body, or specific body parts, typically rooted in
        the belief that one is “fat” or “too big”. Body dissatisfaction plays a
        substantial role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Body Dysmorphic Disorder:</span>
        Severe preoccupation with appearance and body image. Intense focus on
        perceived flaws or defects in appearance that are extremely minor or can
        not be seen by others. May result in embarrassment, shame, or anxiety
        surrounding social situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Body Image Disturbance:</span>
        A mindset categorized by a negative perception and attitude regarding
        physical appearance (Deogracias-Schleich et al., 2022; Heider et al.,
        2018). Those with BID typically have a misconception that their bodies
        are bigger than they actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Bulimia Nervosa:</span>
        Recurrent and frequent episodes of eating unusually large amounts
        followed by compensation behaviors like fasting, self-induced vomiting,
        abuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas, and excessive exercise. Those
        suffering may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Competitive Thinness:</span>
        A competition-like mindset/situation regarding who is thinner. Typically
        occurs among females and involves body comparisons with others. This can
        result in body dissatisfaction and “motivation” to lose weight through
        numerous methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Contagion Effect:</span>
        Social pressures to engage in behaviors (i.e., dieting, or undertaking
        extreme exercise regimens) which uphold norms of a team or other group.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define"
          >Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS):</span
        >
        The most prevalent eating disorder diagnosis. This is a residual
        category, comprising of the disorders that do not meet the full criteria
        for anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="title-define">Female Athlete Triad:</span>
        A spectrum involving the three elements of energy (intake and
        expenditure), menstrual cycles, and bone health. When a female athlete
        does not properly fuel their body, they may experience chronic fatigue,
        anemia, lower bone density, and amenorrhea – the absence of three or
        more consecutive menstrual cycles.
